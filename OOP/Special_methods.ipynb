Then Python passes the just created object to `__init__()` for initialization (setting instances attribute and underlying logic). In most cases we won't need to write our own custom `.__new__()` method (or in otherword override the `__new__()` in built in python) as python handles that internally unless we are customizing immutable types like `tuple` or `string` classes, Controlling how instance are creating (implementing singletons or caching...etc) or we wish to skip/ bypass the `__init__()` for some reason, say we want the instance attribute to be initialized in a different way from our our `__init__()` those it...
